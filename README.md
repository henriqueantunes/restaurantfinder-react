# Restaurant Finder React App

This project was created to exemplify an application build using react hooks
It uses [Material UI](https://mui.com/) as a component library

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Building and Running the APP

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

to install all the dependencies of the project

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the unit test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
The tests are just simple unit tests to check if the App was build and the main App component is running

### `npm cypress`

Launches the integration test runner using cypress, in the interactive watch mode.\
Cypress tests some interaction between the components and search function of the App
it needs the [backend](https://github.com/henriqueantunes/restaurantfinder) running for tests to
complete without errors

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
